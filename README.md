#RestaurantAssistantChatBot


The idea is to create an AI-powered restaurant assistant that works through a chat system. The application is designed to help restaurants save employees’ time by automatically answering guests’ frequently asked questions.

The assistant will provide information specific to the restaurant it belongs to and also handle reservations.

This repository includes an API that processes user requests from the chat, leverages the OpenAI API to understand and respond, and then selects the appropriate tools to either provide the correct answer or place a table booking for the desired time.

I’m still actively developing this project, so stay tuned for updates!
